## Just some random PHPStorm Live Templates that I use for myself.

## Installation

1. In PHPStorm 2021.1+, add a new settings repository.
    - Go to Preferences > Tools > Settings Repository.
    - Add a new Read-only Source with the URL: `https://github.com/ProxiBlue/hyva-templates`
    - When prompted, enter your personal access token from step 1.
2. Restart PHPStorm for the new templates to become available.
    - After restarting, go to Preferences > Editor > Live Templates.
    - You should now seethe templates prefixed with “Hyva”.
